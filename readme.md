## GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW ##
The game starts with the player in the middle of a randomly generated maze with an ambient
enemy randomly walking around it.

Winning text will display upon reaching the maze exit.

Resetting the game state will remove any present winning text, bring the player back to the spawn as well as randomly choosing a new starting for the enemy. The maze layout and its exit remains the same.
